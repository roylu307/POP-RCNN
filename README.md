# Point Pyramid RCNN

This is a reproduced repo of 'Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with Point Pyramid for 3D Object Detection'

The code is mainly based on [OpenPCDet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet).

## Introduction
We provide code and training configurations of PA-RCNN on the KITTI and Waymo Open dataset.
